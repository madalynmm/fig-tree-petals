# Weather Dashboard

## Project Usage:

This application uses an open weather API to retrieve the current weather for any given city. Once the user searches for a city, the current weather, along with the 5-Day forecast, is displayed. The previous searches are then stored using local storage and displayed underneath the search bar.
